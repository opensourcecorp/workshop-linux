dummy-web-app
=============

`dummy-web-app` provides a no-op endpoint for participants in the OSC Linux
Workshop to hit as part of Challenge 5. The server itself is (supposed to be)
always running just fine, but Challenge 5 prevents teams from hitting the server
until they open a client-side firewall ruile.
