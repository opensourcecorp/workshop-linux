Oh no! Our app isn't running!
=============================

Your company runs a handful of web applications on their Linux servers.
Unfortunately, it seems that at least one of them has stopped responding to
healthcheck pings. This is *bad* -- every second that service isn't running, the
company isn't making any money! Well, at least that's how your boss feels. You
just work here.

Regardless, it's up to you and your team to get the service running again, and
fast! You'll continue to accrue points for the successful progress you make
towards getting the app running again.

Good luck!
