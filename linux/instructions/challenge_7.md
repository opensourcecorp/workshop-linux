Challenge 7: Git SSH Setup
==============================

We just got hired by a very famous movie star (who's name may not be disclosed)
to create a new version of our app for their specific use case. Our lead
engineers were working on putting together the new app, but they mysteriously
dissappeared while on a golfing trip a few weeks past. We were told that the
code was about ready to deploy, just hadn't gotten the chance to merge it into
main. See if you can figure out how to get it up and running.

The name of the app is carrot-cruncher. The last dev got the repo cloned somewhere, 
but they never said where... hopefully you'll able to find it. When you do, supposedly
there was a new branch pushed to the remote repo, so you'll need to figure out how to
authenticate to that repo, clone the remote branches down, then you'll be off to 
the races... Goodluck!
