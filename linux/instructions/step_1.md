Step 1: Rebuild the app binary
==============================

You hop into the production server and need to figure out why the application isn't 
running. Based on the architecture diagram for the app and your knowledge of your 
company's deployment pipelines, you know the source code for it
should have been dumped into the directory `/opt/app`. That's probably the best
place to start looking; as a first step, see if you can get the app binary
built. Note that the application is written in Go, so you might need to look up
how to build a Go binary.

Take note of any error messages when trying to build it, and fix any issues you
find.
