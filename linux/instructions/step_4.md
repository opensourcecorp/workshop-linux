Step 4: Git branch management
==============================

We just got hired by a very famous movie star (who's name may not be disclosed) to create 
a new version of our app for their specific use case. Our lead engineers were working on 
putting together the new app, but they mysteriously dissappeared while on a golfing trip 
a few weeks past. We were told that the code was about ready to deploy, just hadn't gotten 
the chance to merge it into main. See if you can figure out how to get it up and running.

(Hint: the name of the app is carrot-cruncher)
